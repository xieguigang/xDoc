# GDITransform
_namespace: [Microsoft.VisualBasic.Imaging](./index.md)_





### Methods

#### Centre
```csharp
Microsoft.VisualBasic.Imaging.GDITransform.Centre(System.Drawing.Rectangle)
```
Gets the center location of the region rectangle.

|Parameter Name|Remarks|
|--------------|-------|
|rect|-|


#### RotateImage
```csharp
Microsoft.VisualBasic.Imaging.GDITransform.RotateImage(System.Drawing.Image,System.Single)
```
Creates a new Image containing the same image only rotated

|Parameter Name|Remarks|
|--------------|-------|
|image|The @``T:System.Drawing.Image`` to rotate|
|angle|The amount to rotate the image, clockwise, in degrees|


_returns: A new @``T:System.Drawing.Bitmap`` that is just large enough
 to contain the rotated image without cutting any corners off._

>  cosine = adjacent/hypotenuse

>  The names are based on the right side corners, because thats
